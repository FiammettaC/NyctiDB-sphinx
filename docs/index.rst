Minerva: An Open-Source Library for Bioprocesses
=========================================================================

.. image:: graphics/logo.png
   :scale: 25 %

Minerva is a relational database with (i) bio-kinetic models; (ii) process and modeling information; (iii) and an expert system.

Key Features & Capabilities
---------------------------
* **Fast and flexible.** 
  Minerva have basic building blocks to design and simulate a bioprocess. 

* **Understandable data.**
  The data is collected in an open standard file format, called JSON. It uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. 

* **Standarized construction of models.**
  The evaluation of thousands of biorefinery designs is streamlined through smart and efficient management of biorefinery parameters to evaluate sets of design decisions and scenarios.

* **Accesible for all and to all.**
  Several first principle models are inside this database. Some of the most importants are: the aerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisia or Escherichia coli or the anaerobic growth of Mannheimia succiniciproducens.
